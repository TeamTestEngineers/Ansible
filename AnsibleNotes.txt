ansible all -a 'date'
You will see all date command has been executed in all the managed nodes.
Ansible all -a 'ls -a'
The above command will execute thelist of files in all the managed nodes.  

Ansible reads the file called as inventory file. to identify the information about the managed nodes
the name of this inventory file is "Hosts" and it is present in "/etc/ansible" folder
open this file and copy the Ip addres's of all the managed nodes

172.31.36.247
172.31.36.219
172.31.36.177

finally save and quit. these are private ip's

Ansible does not require any client software to be installed on the managed nodes. 
it uses an "agent less" policy to configure remote servers
i.e it requires only password less ssh to be established between the conrtoller and managed nodes. 
hence it is called as the "push model".

Ansible perfomrs remote configuation of servers in 3 different ways,  
1. Adhoc commands 
2. Playbooks 
3. Ansible roles.  
  
  All these 3 ways are depedent on each other. which means, to learn 'Ansible roles' first we need to learn playbooks
and to learn 'playbooks' we need to learn 'adhoc commands'. Adhoc commands are the basics of ansible. once we are clear 
with adhoc commands plabooks becomes easy and once we are clearwith playbooks ansible roles become very easy. 
Adhoc commands are the basicof individual command.

lets see how "Adhoc commands" work below is the syntax format
 _____________________________________________________________________________________
|										      |
|ansible all/groupname/ipaddressof -i <path_of_inventory_file> -m <module_name> -a ' '|
|_____________________________________________________________________________________|

parameter:  all       -> adhoc command to be executed in all the managed nodes
            groupname -> adhoc commands to be executed in managed nodes affeliated to certian groups
	    ipaddress -> adhoc commands to be executed in the specific address of the ipAddress. 

options:    -i        ->  inveroty file 
            -m        -> which command module you would like to work on.  

arguments:  -a        -> each module will have their own set of argumets to be passed we need to pass within 
			 single quotes.

ex: ansible all -i /etc/ansible/hosts -m command -a 'free -m'
the free command will displaty the memory usage of the system, with the help of about ex for ansible 
we can exeucte the the free -m command and check all the memory usage of all the managed nodes.  

what is an inventory file? 
Inventory file is any file where you will store the ip address of the managed nodes. the default invenotry file is located in the /etc/ansible/hosts
you dont have to use the default invetory file, you can create your own file now and mention the ip address within the file. below are the steps to follow

1. vim myinventory 
2. Adding below ip address to myinventory file.
	172.31.36.247
	172.31.36.219
   save and quit
3. execute the same command but instead of default file use myinventory file
   ansible all -i myinventory -m command -a 'free -m'
4. as we have only 2 ip address the command will be executed in only 2 managed nodes(172.31.36.247,172.31.36.219). 
 
by default ansible assume to execute the /etc/ansible/hosts inventory file and command module.


 _______________________________________________________________________________
|command module. 								                                                |	
|Ansible command to find the memory infomration of all the managed nodes.	      |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|	 
|ansible all -i /etc/ansible/hosts -m command -a 'free -m'			                |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|when we use the default inventory file we need not specify the -i option. 	    |
|and since default module is the command module we can skip -m option. 		      |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|----> ansible all -a 'free -m'							                                    |
|_______________________________________________________________________________|

 _______________________________________________________________________________
|shell module: Is used to run the shell scripts on the manages nodes.		        | 
|Ansible commands for instakling Docker on all the managed nodes. 		          |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|ansible all -m shell -a 'curl -fsSL get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh'		        |
|ansible all -m shell -a 'sh get-docker.sh'					                            |
|_______________________________________________________________________________|

 _______________________________________________________________________________
|copy module: this is used for copying files and directories. from controller 	|
|             to managed nodes.							                                    |
|ansible command to copy /etc/passwd file from controller to the managed nodes. |	
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|ansible all -m  copy -a 'src=/etc/passwd dest=/tmp'				                    |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|using copy command it is also possible to copy directories along with 		      |
|subdirectories into the managed nodes.						                              | 
|create multiple directories on the controller node machinemkdir-p d1/d2/d3/d4	|
| to copy this entire folder structure				 		                              |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ansible all -m copy-a 'src=d1'dest=/tmp'					                            |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|copy module can be used for changing the ownership group ownership and 	      |
|permission of files. 								                                          |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|ansible all -m copy -a 'src=file2 dest=/tmp owner=root group=root mode-765' -b	|
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|"-b" stands for become, it is used to for giving higher privilages on the	    |
| managed nodes									                                                |

the disadvantage of adhoc command is they can only work with one module 
andon set of commands to perfrom complex configuartation and managment activiteies 
we can use playbooks. 

Play books are created using YAML.
and they can work on multiple modules of ansible. we can also implement programming 
feature like if conditions and loops where a particular module can be executed repeatdly 
for multiple times and also modules can be executed. and also module can vbe excuted based on 
specific condtion
playbooks are designed to work on a singl;e host 
/group of hosts or all the host present in the 
inventory file. A single playbook can contain multiple plays
and a play contains the exact ask that should be perfomed on the 
remote server

the main advantage of the playbook is resuability.


Anisble playbook to install firewalld on all managed nodes. 
---
- name: Install firewalld on all managed nodes
  hosts: all
  tasks:
   -  name: Install firewalld
      apt: 
       name: firewalld
       state: present
       update_cache: yes


to check whether the playbook is created syntaciatlly correct or not. 
ansible-playbook playbook1.yml --syntax-check

to execute the playbook 
ansible-playbook playbook1.yml -b
